In this series of posts I will explain a set of my attempts, roadmap and other stuff related to ```My Hacks```.
By ```My Hacks``` I will refer to a task that I usually I've not implemented before but maybe I've used as a service or a framework without getting into it's details.
Starting from finding an idea to how I get stuck will be sketched here.
I believe that this will be useful because It's a kind of documentation, also sharing things will encourage me to finish those tasks.
Hope one day they will be useful to anyone, or at least me!.
